Why this project exists
Programming for Career aims to blend learning with real outcomes. Students work on meaningful projects that reflect tasks found in industry roles. The platform guides learners through problem identification, planning, implementation, testing, and reflection. The project emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and practical outcomes. It is built to scale from a small classroom to a full open-source LMS used by diverse learners.

What you’ll find in this repository
- Core platform code: backend services, authentication, project management, assignment workflows, and course authoring.
- Frontend: a responsive UI to browse courses, track progress, and submit work.
- Data model and API contracts: clear schemas and stable interfaces for both internal and external use.
- Sample courses and projects: starter content to show project-based learning in action.
- Devops and infrastructure: scripts and configurations for local development, CI, and deployment.
- Documentation: developer guides, user guides, and contribution instructions.

High-level architecture
- Frontend: a modern JavaScript single-page app that consumes RESTful APIs and renders learning flows. It supports offline progress where possible and progressive enhancement for accessibility.
- Backend: a modular service layer with authentication, course management, project submission, and analytics. Services communicate via RESTful endpoints and asynchronous events.
- Data store: a relational database for core data, with read replicas for reporting workloads. File storage for assets and student submissions is managed via an object store integration.
- Authentication and authorization: role-based access control (RBAC) with support for OAuth2 providers and single sign-on in enterprise setups.
- CI/CD: automated tests, linting, and deployment pipelines to keep quality high and releases predictable.

Features and capabilities
- Course authoring and project wiring: instructors can author courses, define projects, and attach rubrics, assets, and evaluation criteria.
- Project-based learning workflows: learners work through real-world tasks, submit artifacts, and receive structured feedback.
- Progress tracking and dashboards: learners see their progress across courses and projects; instructors get insights into cohort progress.
- Assessments and rubrics: automated checks for code quality where appropriate, plus instructor review for subjective assessments.
- Collaboration: learners can work in small teams, share work, and comment on submissions in a structured way.
- Open-source and extensible: modular design allows contributors to replace components, add plugins, or adapt for different curricula.
- Accessibility and responsiveness: the UI is usable with keyboard navigation, screen readers, and responsive layouts for mobile devices.
- Localization: language packs and translation-friendly strings to support diverse learners.

  - Rubric: id, criteria, weight
  - Lesson: id, course_id, title, content, resources
  - Asset: id, course_id or project_id, type (video, document, image), path or URL
- Relationships
  - A course has many lessons and projects
  - A project belongs to a specific course
  - A user submits work for a project
  - Feedback ties to submissions and rubrics
- Storage considerations
  - Course content and assets stored in a content store
  - Submissions stored with references to file storage

  - GET /api/courses/{id}: get course details
  - GET /api/courses/{id}/projects: list projects for a course
  - POST /api/projects: create a project
  - POST /api/submissions: submit work for a project
  - GET /api/submissions/{id}: fetch submission status and feedback
  - POST /api/auth/login: authenticate
  - POST /api/auth/register: register new user
- Frontend user flows
